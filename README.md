# Signal and Image Processing application

To use this application you will need to download the CImg library from this link http://cimg.eu/download.shtml. Our application can perform several basic (e.g. making a negative) and more advanced operations (e.g. Fourier transform and morphological operations) on raster images. The application is written to be used in a console. To see a full list of functionalities just type --help. Enjoy toying with it :)
